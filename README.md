## ABOUT
This script pulls recent Computer Science papers from arXiv in the cryptography / computer security category

## DETAILS
The program stages the titles then prompts a user for a title number to show show the abstract and link

### Dev
Still a little buggy, I'm sure the requesting abstracts function will break on some inuputs. I am aware of inputting '0' returns the last index paper atm.

I'd like to also give the user the option to re-print the title listing after they have viewed an abstract.
